# garden irrigator esp32
this project will make you irrigate your loved plants with the power of eletronics and code, it uses the esp32 to send you on telegram with a bot the news about your garden and the relevant temperatures, humidity and many more things. who said that tecnology will kill plants?
to make this project you will need:
-esp32 (its better to use one with higher flash memory and ram memory, also i suggest to use an esp32 with an external antenna like an esp32-32u so it will have a better range for the wifi with the 2.4g 802.11b/g/n protocol)
